# Copypastes
# RULES:
# Preamble
This repository is meant to gather internet copypastes in multiple languages by anyone who wants.
I hope you'll find it useful and enjoyable.
1. Feel free to add whatever paste you want, but please make sure ur paste wasn't already added but someone else.
2. Please commit your pastes to branch suitable for language of the paste u add. And don't be scared of merging the branches, I chose the organization repo for restricting merge request feature :)
3. Every content allowed, it's the nature of the Internet tho.
4. Please be sure your paste is saved as a textfile (.txt extension) and properly formatted to be able to read without horizontal scrolling. Feel free to edit a paste if it doesn't meet the requirment, but edit only the way it's formatted, not the copypaste itself!
5. Emoji copypastes should be paste as .png as it's impossible to copy emoji from sites like Facebook etc.
6. DO NOT FUCKING DARE TO DELETE A PASTE UNLESS IT WAS COMMITED BY YOU.
7. Have fun :)
